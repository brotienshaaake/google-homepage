The project was to make a simple google page using HTML and CSS

getting the page itself to look the way i wanted to was a little bit of a struggle. Certain lines of cide didn't react how i expected them to so i  did what i could to make them look a certain way. Making the page smaller makes things look odd BUT on a web display things do look pretty nice i think. 

Given that i made this in a day it feels pretty nice even though things are pretty simple. It makes me wonder what i can make in a week and after i learn a lot more about web development. It only goes up from here!
